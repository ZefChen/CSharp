//1.FizzBuzzis a group word game for children to teach them about division.
//Players take turns to count incrementally, replacing any number divisible by three
//with the word /fizz/, any number divisible by five with the word /buzz/,
// and any number divisible by both with /fizzbuzz/.
//Create a console application in Chapter03 named Exercise03 that outputs a simulated
//FizzBuzz game counting up to 100. The output should look something like the following
